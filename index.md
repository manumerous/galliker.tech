### „If knowledge can create problems, it is not through ignorance that we can solve them.“ - Isaac Asimov

Through actively shaping and increasing the accesibility of technology I aim to provide society with powerful tools to contribute to the betterment of mankind. In particular, I find the prospect of intelligent robotic systems interacting with dynamic, uncontrolled and unstructured real-world environments captivating. With my strong belief in collaborative research and the open dissemination of knowledge I hope that this website provides you with inspiration and me with new connections with like-minded people!
