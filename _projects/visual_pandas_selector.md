The Visual Pandas Selector is a tool to visually select portions of numeric time-series data from a pandas dataframe. The tool is intended to provide an fast interactive way for manual data selection, as can be very useful in for example machine learning, regression or system identification.

Easily configure the tool to plot dataframe columns in vertically stacked subplots and view data distributions with the included histogram feature. With a simple click and drag, you can then select horizontal data windows, and let the tool automatically combine them into a new dataframe.

The project is aviable on github and can be installed using pip.
