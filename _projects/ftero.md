Over the past few decades, there has been a clear trend towards the use of renewable energy sources. Energy security and sustainability are major concerns for countries around the world. Despite significant advancements in well-established renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar, there is still a need for innovative solutions that can provide large amounts of electricity at a competitive cost.
Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) represents one family of such innovative approaches.

During the last year of my bachelor studies at ETH Zurich I joined the student project ftero where we developed, designed and pro-
totyped a small scale AWE system and and investigated various research questions related to flight controls and adaptive lightweight composite structures.






## Airborne Wind Energy

AWE systems harnesses the power of wind through a wing or kite, connected to the ground via a tether, to generate electricity. Hereby, the power can either be generated onboard, where the energy is harvested by an onboard turbine and generator and conducted to the ground through the tether, or on-ground, where the resulting aerodynamical forces are transferred through the tether to a generatior on the ground.

AWE systems have several potential advantages over traditional wind turbine systems, including:

- Lower cost: AWE systems are typically lighter and require fewer materials than wind turbines, making them less expensive to manufacture and install.

- Increased efficiency: AWE systems can harness winds at higher altitudes, where winds tend to be stronger and more consistent than at ground level.

- Unlocking additional wind resources: AWE systems can be deployed in a variety of locations, including deep sea offshore areas, where traditional wind turbines may not be feasible.

Despite their potential benefits, AWE systems are still in the early stages of development and have in 2022 not yet been widely deployed due to several technical and regulatory challenges, including issues related to safety and reliability.

<!-- 
 To be able to meet the rising demand for renewable energy, innovative solutions are required. For this purpose, the project ftero at ETH Zurich is developing an Airborne Wind Energy System. Using an unmanned aircraft that is tethered to the ground, the system can capture wind energy and turn it into electricity with an efficiency that surpasses conventional wind turbines. The aircraft is carried by the wind like a kite, while a generator on the ground creates electricity by slowly unwinding the tether that connects the two. During nine months, the ftero team comprised of ten bachelor students went through all the steps of product development, from the idea to the finished product. -->
